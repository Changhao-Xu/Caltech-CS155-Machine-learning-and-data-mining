\begin{itemize}
\item Due noon, March 24th, via Gradescope.
\item No extensions, and you cannot use late hours.
\item No collaboration, you must answer these questions all on your own.
\item You are free to ask clarification questions on Piazza.
\item This exam is designed to take 3-5 hours to do.
\item Suggestion: Write the solutions by hand (no LaTeX) and submit a scanned copy.  It will save you time.
\item All questions have short answers.  If your answer is very long, you're probably over-thinking it.
